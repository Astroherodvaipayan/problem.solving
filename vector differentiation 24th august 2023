Today I revised key concepts of vector integration. did problem-solving for around 2 hours.
the key topics I covered today were:
1. Finding r- position vectors
2. Finding velocity vectors
3. Finding acceleration vectors
4. Finding the cross product of 2 vectors along a vector 'a'
5. Finding the dot product of 2 perpendicular vectors.
